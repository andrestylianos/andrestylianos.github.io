Introduction

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why?&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! After quite some time thinking about starting a blog, and never actually doing it, I've decided to go ahead with it so that I can do my part in the community and share some things I've learned, with the hopes that it may be useful to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;a&amp;#95;little&amp;#95;bit&amp;#95;about&amp;#95;me&quot;&gt;A little bit about me&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did a Computer Engineering course in Brazil. Mostly Java and Javascript with a bit of C, C++ and Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worked remotely for Process Street, doing Scala and Javascript. Check them out! Great product, and great place to work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently working with ClojureScript at GreenPowerMonitor. Great place as well, and quite willing to explore new grounds as seen by the usage of ClojureScript (and also F#).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't really see myself going back to non functional programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what&amp;#95;am&amp;#95;i&amp;#95;going&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;be&amp;#95;blogging&amp;#95;about?&quot;&gt;What am I going to be blogging about?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only thing set in stone is that it's going to be programming related things. At the start that means mostly Clojure(Script), but as I experiment with other things they will end up here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
